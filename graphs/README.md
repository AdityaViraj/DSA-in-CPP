# Graphs

Graph algorithms for connectivity, shortest paths, and ordering.

## Topics
- Graph representations (adj list)
- BFS / DFS
- Connected components
- Topological sort
- Shortest path basics

## Problems (suggested)
01. Graph Representation (adj list)  
02. BFS Traversal  
03. DFS Traversal  
04. Connected Components  
05. Detect Cycle (undirected)  
06. Detect Cycle (directed)  
07. Topological Sort (Kahn/DFS)  
08. Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph (BFS)  
09. Dijkstra (weighted, non-negative)  
10. Union-Find (DSU) basics

## Notes
- Always clarify directed vs undirected.
- Track visited carefully.
