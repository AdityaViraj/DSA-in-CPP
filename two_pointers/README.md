# Two Pointers

Two pointers reduce nested loops by moving indices intelligently.

## Common types
- Opposite-end pointers (l/r)
- Slow/Fast pointers
- Partition pointers (low/mid/high)

## Problems 
01. Two Sum (sorted)  
02. Remove Duplicates (sorted)  
03. Remove Duplicates II (allow at most twice)  
04. Move Zeros  
05. Reverse String/Array  
06. Palindrome Check  
07. Container With Most Water  
08. 3Sum (sort + two pointers)  
09. Dutch National Flag (0/1/2 sort)  
10. Merge Two Sorted Arrays (in-place idea)

## Notes
- Opposite-end pointers usually require sorted/structured data.
- Slow/Fast = build answer in-place while scanning.
