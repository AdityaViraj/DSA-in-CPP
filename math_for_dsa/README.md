# Math for DSA

Math tools that directly improve problem solving.

## Topics
- Time complexity basics (Big-O)
- Modular arithmetic
- GCD/LCM
- Prime sieve
- Combinatorics basics
- Bit manipulation basics

## Problems (suggested)
01. Fast exponentiation  
02. GCD/LCM  
03. Prime check  
04. Sieve of Eratosthenes  
05. Modular inverse (optional)  
06. nCr basics (optional)  
07. Bit tricks (set bits, power of two)

## Notes
- Keep implementations clean and reusable.
