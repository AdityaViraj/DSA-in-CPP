# Dynamic Programming (DP)

DP = recursion + memoization, or tabulation.

## Core ideas
- State definition
- Transition
- Base cases
- Optimization (space reduction)

## Problems (suggested)
01. Fibonacci (memo/tab)  
02. Climbing Stairs  
03. House Robber  
04. Coin Change  
05. 0/1 Knapsack  
06. Longest Common Subsequence  
07. Longest Increasing Subsequence  
08. Matrix DP (grid paths)  
09. Partition DP (advanced)

## Notes
- First write recursion, then memoize, then tabulate.
