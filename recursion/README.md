# Recursion

Recursion breaks problems into smaller subproblems.

## Topics
- Base case & recurrence
- Backtracking basics
- Recursion vs iteration
- Stack depth / space complexity

## Problems (suggested)
01. Factorial / Fibonacci  
02. Power (fast exponentiation)  
03. Reverse Array (recursive)  
04. Check Palindrome (recursive)  
05. Generate Subsets  
06. Generate Permutations  
07. N-Queens (advanced)  
08. Rat in a Maze (optional)

## Notes
- Time depends on branching factor.
- Space includes recursion stack.
