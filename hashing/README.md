# Hashing (Maps/Sets)

Hashing helps solve problems in near O(n) average time.

## Topics
- Frequency counting
- Two sum / pair problems
- Prefix-sum + hashmap for subarrays
- Duplicates and uniqueness tracking

## Problems (suggested)
01. Frequency Count (unordered_map)  
02. First Unique Element  
03. Two Sum (indices)  
04. Intersection / Union of arrays  
05. Subarray Sum Equals K (count)  
06. Longest Subarray Sum K  
07. Longest Consecutive Sequence  
08. Anagram check (strings)  
09. Group Anagrams (optional)

## Notes
- Time: average O(1) per operation, worst-case O(n).
- Space usually O(n).
