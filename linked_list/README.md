# Linked List

Pointer-based linear structure.

## Topics
- Insert/delete at head/tail
- Slow/Fast pointer tricks
- Reversal patterns
- Cycle detection

## Problems (suggested)
01. Build & Print Linked List  
02. Insert at Head/Tail  
03. Delete a Node (by value/position)  
04. Reverse Linked List  
05. Find Middle (slow/fast)  
06. Detect Cycle (Floyd)  
07. Remove Cycle  
08. Merge Two Sorted Lists  
09. Reverse in K Groups (advanced)

## Notes
- Many LL problems test pointer discipline.
