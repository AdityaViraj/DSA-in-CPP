# Binary Search

Binary search applies when the answer space is monotonic.

## Variants
- Classic search in sorted array
- First/last occurrence
- Lower bound / upper bound
- Binary search on answer

## Problems (suggested)
01. Binary Search (basic)  
02. First Occurrence  
03. Last Occurrence  
04. Count Occurrences  
05. Search in Rotated Sorted Array  
06. Peak Element  
07. Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array  
08. Find Square Root (integer)  
09. Capacity / Answer-based BS (e.g., shipping packages)

## Notes
- Typical complexity: O(log n)
- Always define invariant and boundaries carefully.
